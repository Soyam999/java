            <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.
                <br> It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. 
                <br>It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.</p>
